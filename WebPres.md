# Question: Does being "Race out of Place" in San Jose lead to a more severe outcome at a police stop? 

## Project Goals
In this project, we aim to investigate a phenomenon known as "Race out of Place". It is well known that some racial groups experience more frequent and more severe outcomes in police interactions. We hypothesize that when people are in an area where they are not the majority race -- they are 'out of place' -- they will experience more severe outcomes (for instance, they are more likely to be arrested). Policing in the context of race is an extremely important question because of well known disparities between racial groups in police interactions. But, if police tend to more harshly police groups in areas where they are not the majority race, this signals that police may not only take into account the race of their suspect, but also the racial context around their suspect, an important distinction in understand the implicit biases of policing.
